This project is an implementation of the analysis and modeling pipeline for the competitive data science project conducted as part of the **Data Quest Challenge 2025** competition

It aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit, based on a wide range of features including demographic information, past campaign outcomes, and previous customer interactions.

## Business Understanding

In the highly competitive banking industry, acquiring new customers and promoting financial products efficiently is essential for growth. One key challenge is identifying which customers are most likely to respond positively to marketing campaigns ‚Äî particularly for long-term financial products like term deposits.

By leveraging historical customer data, including demographics, interaction history, and past campaign outcomes, the bank can build a predictive model to segment customers based on their likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit. This allows marketing teams to target efforts more precisely, reduce costs, and improve conversion rates.

## Data Overview

The dataset contains detailed information on individual bank customers targeted in a marketing campaign for term deposit products. It includes demographic attributes such as age, job, marital status, and education, as well as financial history like previous loan defaults, housing loans, and personal loans. Additionally, it records interaction details from past and current campaigns, including contact frequency, communication channel, and campaign outcomes.

To enhance predictive performance, the dataset also incorporates macroeconomic indicators such as consumer confidence, employment variation, and interest rates. The target variable is binary ‚Äî indicating whether a customer subscribed to a term deposit. This data enables the development of a machine learning model to predict customer response and improve marketing effectiveness.
